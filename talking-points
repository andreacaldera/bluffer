The problem
-----------
> Frontend team - multiple dependencies on different endpoints.
> We can't interfere with other codebases.
> Testing features on brands that aren't ready yet.
> We can't ship features that rely on mocks in the codebase.
> Difficult to visualise Monty API calls.
The solution
------------
> A reverse proxy.
> A reverse proxy that mocks - when we want it to.
Benefits
--------
> We can see what Monty is doing.
> We can change what we want.
> We can proxy multiple services.
Problems
--------
> You have to change your .env file.
> Only makes sense to run it locally, at the moment.
> Monty cache
Questions
---------
> It is useful?
> Can QAs use it meaningfully?
> Can devs and QAs share mocks?
> Should it be deployed?
> Should it be integrated into Samir's caching proxy?
Further development
-------------------
> UI improvements.
> Sharing mocks.
> DB.
